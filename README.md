# Short-Term-Process-Scheduler
CST-315 Project 3

## How to Run
1. Compile scheduler.cpp by entering ```g++ -pthread -o scheduler scheduler.cpp``` into your Linux terminal
2. Compile cmdLnInterpreter.cpp by entering ```g++ -o run cmdLnInterpreter.cpp -lstdc++fs```
3. Run the command line interpreter using ```./run```
4. Execute the scheduler by entering ```./scheduler``` from within the interpreter (entering this from outside the interpreter should work as well)
